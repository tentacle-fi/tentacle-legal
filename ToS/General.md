Note: UBQ price data is pulled from the oracle run by the Ubiq team. This oracle only updates every 30 minutes, so USD prices could have a minimum of a 30 minute update delay.

Chart Delay: For now, all charts are delayed intentionally by approximately 15 minutes. This is due to a design decision on how data is stored, and is meant to reduce operational costs for the charts initially.
